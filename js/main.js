Over the past 10 years, workwear has gotten increasingly casual, to the point where everyone from the intern to the boss is wearing sneakers and jeans. Perhaps you haven't heard that informal office environments are linked with lower productivity. If that's not enough to get you into a suit or dress, the fantastic array of more formal clothing landing in stores this fall should be. We've compiled 50 tips and trends to help you get back to looking like you're ready to do business or, at the very least, stop treating every day like casual Friday.

Avoid the Mr. Rogers look by choosing one that's lightweight (say, a fine-gauge merino wool) and not too tight. Otherwise, it will inevitably gape at the buttons and pull at the shoulders. Pair with a sharp oxford button-down and a tie, then rise above the grandpa jokes.","credit":"","photocredit":"Illustration by Cari Vander Yact","imgType":"png","imgSmall":"43_small.png","imgLarge":"43_large.png","imgWidth":330,"imgHeight":407},

Culottes, for those who didn't live through the Eighties, are hybrid shorts-skirts wide enough that they sometimes look like cutoff M.C. Hammer pants. These don't—they're navy, well made, and have an awesome fit: loose but not baggy, offering mobility and femininity. I wore them to a meeting at a new client's office and was complimented almost immediately. Several strangers stopped me during my subway commute home. One woman said I looked “amazing,” while another called me “so chic.” Near the end of the trip, a third lady simply pointed at my shorts-pants. “Those are so great,” she enthused. Get a pair and wear them with heels and a fitted top. I swear, they're not too weird. Really. –Shibon Kennedy","credit":"With culottes: Tibi bee mules, $262","photocredit":"Photograph by B.

Spring, an app released in August, may get closer to persuading customers to buy designer items on their phones. Its clean, easy-to-navigate interface resembles Instagram, and any fashion brand can sign up for an account. Goods are displayed one by one in pictures that are more aspirationally pretty than those on traditional e-commerce sites. Shoppers can follow their favorite labels—Michael Kors, Derek Lam, and almost 500 others have joined up—and, when they see something they like, snag it with the swipe of a finger. (Goodbye, digital shopping cart.) The app takes a cut, but it's a smaller percentage for companies that offer free shipping and easy returns. Suddenly, spending real money feels like a game.
