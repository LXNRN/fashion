Over the past 10 years, workwear has gotten increasingly casual, to the point where everyone from the intern to the boss is wearing sneakers and jeans. Perhaps you haven't heard that informal office environments are linked with lower productivity. If that's not enough to get you into a suit or dress, the fantastic array of more formal clothing landing in stores this fall should be. We've compiled 50 tips and trends to help you get back to looking like you're ready to do business or, at the very least, stop treating every day like casual Friday.
