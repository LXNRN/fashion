I wore them to a meeting at a new client's office and was complimented almost immediately. Several strangers stopped me during my subway commute home. One woman said I looked “amazing,” while another called me “so chic.” Near the end of the trip, a third lady simply pointed at my shorts-pants. “Those are so great,” she enthused. Get a pair and wear them with heels and a fitted top. I swear, they're not too weird. Really. –Shibon Kennedy","credit":"With culottes: Tibi bee mules, $262","photocredit":"Photograph by B.

No one's nailed it. Spring, an app released in August, may get closer to persuading customers to buy designer items on their phones. Its clean, easy-to-navigate interface resembles Instagram, and any fashion brand can sign up for an account. Goods are displayed one by one in pictures that are more aspirationally pretty than those on traditional e-commerce sites. Shoppers can follow their favorite labels—Michael Kors, Derek Lam, and almost 500 others have joined up—and, when they see something they like, snag it with the swipe of a finger. (Goodbye, digital shopping cart.) The app takes a cut, but it's a smaller percentage for companies that offer free shipping and easy returns. Suddenly, spending real money feels like a game.
